### What are REST APIs?

- The main feature of REST API is statelessness. Statelessness means that servers do not save client data between requests.

- Client requests to the server are similar to URLs you type in your browser to visit a website. The response from the server is plain data or in one of several formats HTTP: JSON(Javascript Object), HTML, XLT, Python or PHP.

- JSON is the most generally popular file format to use because, despite its name, it's language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans an machines.

## Benefits of RESTful APIs
 - ####  Scalability : 
RESTful APIs are highly scalable as they use standard protocols and formats, making it easier to scale up or down the system.

- #### Flexibility :
RESTful APIs are highly flexible as they can be used with any programming language and can be inplemented on any platform or device.

- #### Portability : 
RESTful APIs can be used across different systems, making it easier to integrate different software system.

- #### Efficiency :
RESTful APIs are designed to be efficient, with low overheads and minimal processing requirements, making them ideal for use in high-performance applications.

- #### Security :
RESTful APIs can be secured using standard security protocols such as OAuth, SSL/TLS and HTTPS, providing a secure way to exchange data between systems.
